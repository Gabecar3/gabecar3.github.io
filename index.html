                    <p>
                        I’m Gabe Carvalho, an Aerospace Engineer with a Bachelor’s degree from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. My background spans manufacturing, design, testing, V&V, and spacecraft processing, with a strong focus on safety through innovation.
						I’ve led modification and V&V projects and supported Underway Recovery Training aboard the USS Somerset for Artemis II. As a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt, I bring sharp problem-solving skills, fast learning, and effective leadership to every challenge.
						I’m passionate about pushing the boundaries of aerospace, and outside of work, I enjoy video games, working on cars, and building things as a maker.

                            As project manager for a team of six engineers, I led the design of an unmanned fire-fighting aircraft inspired by the Boeing MG-25 Ariel Refueling Drone, aimed to compete with the CL-415. The aircraft was designed to deliver 2,000 gallons of fire suppressant with a range of 500 nautical miles. I oversaw the detailed design of the wings and conducted Damage Tolerance Analysis to establish inspection intervals and determine component lifespan. I also completed the airworthiness and loading analysis of the aircraft to determine structural design requirements.  Our design, The Ember-Eagle was selected as the best aircraft of the semester, highlighting the success of the project.

                            Led the preliminary design of a twin-jet engine military trainer inspired by the A-10 Warthog, with specific requirements for endurance, rate of climb, max speed, landing distance, and the twin DGEN 380 engines. Despite challenges due to incorrect engine weight data, the team worked together to correct the errors just one week before final presentations. The aircraft, affectionately named "Cinderblock," placed second in the course and received a commendation from the dean of the Aerospace Engineering department for our exceptional redesign efforts in response to the initial inaccurate requirements.

                            Extensively restored a 1982 Chevy S10 for the Grassroots Motorsport $2000 Challenge. Modifications included an engine replacement with a 305 Cubic Inch Small Block Chevy from a Camaro, transmission upgrade to a 4L80E from a 2500HD truck, and differential swap with one from a Ford Explorer. Overhauled the interior with custom gauges, reupholstered the seats, and installed racing harnesses and safety equipment, ensuring full compliance with NHRA and SCCA safety regulations.
