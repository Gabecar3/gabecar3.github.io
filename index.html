                    <p>
                        Hi, I’m Gabe Carvalho — an Aerospace Engineer with a passion for innovation, safety, and solving complex challenges. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Aerospace Engineering from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and bring a strong background in manufacturing, design, testing, verification & validation (V&V), and spacecraft processing.
						With hands-on experience supporting Underway Recovery Training aboard the USS Somerset for Artemis II and leading multiple modification and V&V projects, I thrive in high-stakes environments where precision and creativity intersect. I’m a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt, known for my ability to lead teams, adapt quickly, and deliver results efficiently.
						I’m deeply motivated by the opportunity to work at the forefront of aerospace technology, where every innovation has the potential to enhance safety and push boundaries. Outside of work, I enjoy video games, working on cars, and making things — whether it’s in the garage or with a soldering iron.

                            To enable post-flight transport of the Orion spacecraft from Naval Air Station North Island to Kennedy Space Center, the Orion Recovery Cradle required modification to meet U.S. Air Force requirements for transporting equipment with hazardous commodities aboard a C-17 aircraft. I supported the development of the requirements matrix and led the modification as well as verification and validation (V&V) operations to ensure full compliance and successful project completion.

                            As project manager for a team of five engineers, I led the design of an unmanned fire-fighting aircraft inspired by the Boeing MG-25 Ariel Refueling Drone, aimed to compete with the CL-415. The aircraft was designed to deliver 2,000 gallons of fire suppressant with a range of 500 nautical miles. I oversaw the detailed design of the wings and conducted Damage Tolerance Analysis to establish inspection intervals and determine component lifespan. Our design, The Ember-Eagle was selected as the best aircraft of the semester, highlighting the success of the project.

                            Led the preliminary design of a twin-jet engine military trainer inspired by the A-10 Warthog, with specific requirements for endurance, rate of climb, max speed, landing distance, and the twin DGEN 380 engines. Despite challenges due to incorrect engine weight data, the team worked together to correct the errors just one week before final presentations. The aircraft, affectionately named "Cinderblock," placed second in the course and received a commendation from the dean of the Aerospace Engineering department for our exceptional redesign efforts in response to the initial inaccurate requirements.

                            Extensively restored a 1982 Chevy S10 for the Grassroots Motorsport $2000 Challenge. Modifications included an engine replacement with a 305 Cubix Inch Small Block Chevy from a Camaro, transmission upgrade to a 4L80E from a 2500HD truck, and differential swap with one from a Ford Explorer. Overhauled the interior with custom gauges, reupholstered the seats, and installed racing harnesses and safety equipment, ensuring full compliance with NHRA and SCCA safety regulations.
